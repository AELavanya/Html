               <p> Look around you! The whole world revolves around information and data. As a result, data and information are integral to daily life.
                
                However, that data must be stored somewhere where it can be easily accessed and processed.
                
                That’s where Data Structures come into the picture! 
                
                Data Structure is a systematic process of organizing and storing the data in the main memory of the computer so that it can be managed properly and utilized efficiently. One common example of data structure is a LinkedIn List. </p>
